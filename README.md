**TASK 1 TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION**

**->** Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.

**->** The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

TASK 5 CREDIT CARD FRAUD

**->** Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.

**->** Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**->** Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

**->** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.
